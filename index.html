                <p> When ability is activcated, Paragon starts to charge in 
                    the direction the robot is facing. During the charge, Paragon
                    creates a magnetic field that damages and pushes enemies away
                    from him. Paragon also turns some incoming damage into 
                    <b>DOT</b>, allowing him to heal most of the damage
                    dealt during the durability. After the charge ends, Paragon
                    remains creating an magnetic field, but doesn't move as fast.
